## Additional Translation Tests
The spec tests in the mongosql-rs/test/spec_tests directory attempt to minimally
specify the MongoSQL language. While each spec test query includes an intended
translation, the translations themselves should not be considered part of the
MongoSQL spec.

This directory contains additional translation test cases for queries that are
not covered by the spec tests. The queries in these tests add no extra value
to the spec tests, but present interesting translations not covered by the spec
tests. Again, these translations should not be considered part of the MongoSQL
spec.
