# MongoDB Schema Manager

MongoDB Schema Manager is a tool for generating schemata for MongoDB collections. These schemata are
crucial for proper operation of the MongoDB SQL interface because it is strongly typed and must
know the types of fields in your collections for all but the most simple of queries.

The schemata generated by the MongoDB Schema Manager are the same as those [supported by MongoDB
collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json)
